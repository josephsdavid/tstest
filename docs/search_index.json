To denote a specific point in time, let us say \\(t = 9\\), we would say \\(X_9\\). The collection of all \\(X_n\\) is a stochastic process known as a time series. 2.1.1 Realizations and Ensembles A realization is a particular instance of a time series. It is one of the infinitely many possible time series that could have been observed. As a time series is a stochastic process, each one could be entirely different. The realization Is the one that was actually observed. Sometimes a realization is the only realization possible. We can theorize what an infinite population of those realizations, but it is often the case that there is only one. An ensemble is the theoretical totality of all possible realizations. It is the ensemble of realizations. We can think of that as the population of realizations. When we are thinking of means and variances, we think of them in terms of the ensemble, even though we may only be able to look at a single realization. 2.2 Population Means and Variances It is important to note that when dealing with an ensemble of realizations, each time point is allowed to have its own mean and variance. 2.2.1 The Mean of \\(X_t\\) \\(\\mu_t\\) is the mean of all possible realizations of \\(X_t\\) for a fixed t. 2.2.2 Variance of \\(X_t\\) \\({\\sigma_t}^{2}\\) is the variance of all possible realizations of \\(X_t\\) for a fixed t 2.3 Estimating Mean and Variance for Multiple Realizations Let us say we have \\(n\\) realizations of \\(X_t\\) at time \\(t\\). The average can be then written as \\(\\hat{\\mu_t}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{t_n}\\) Variance is calculated the same way. We are making sample means and sample variances. If we assume the population is normally distributed, this allows us to take confidence intervals on the mean of our set of realizations. However, We have a problem: What to do when we only have one realization? 2.4 Expected Value In short, the expected value \\((E[X])\\) of a random variable (RV) denoted by \\(X\\) is the mean or more intuitively the long run average of the event that variable represents. 2.4.1 Discrete RVs A discrete RV is an RV in which \\(X\\) cannot take on any value, it has specific values it can exist at and that is it. The formula for EV of a discrete RV is as follows: \\[E\\left[X\\right] = \\sum X P\\left(X\\right) = \\mu\\] 2.4.2 Continuous RVs A continuous RV has instead of discrete values a probability distribution/density function, \\(f(x)\\). The formula for EV of a continuous RV is as follows: \\[E\\left[X\\right] = \\int_{a}^{b} xf\\left(x\\right)dx = \\mu\\] Note that is directly analagous to the discrete RV, and that a and b can span to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) Important Note \\[E\\left[X\\right] = \\mu\\] That is the expected value of a RV is equivalent to the population mean 2.4.3 Some Rules Let a and b be constants \\[E\\left[a\\right] = a\\] \\[E[aX] = aE[X] = a\\mu\\] \\[E[aX + b] = aE[X] + E[b] = aE[x] + b = a\\mu+b\\] Knowing these rules, lets try out a challenge: 2.4.4 A challenge in Expected Values Find \\(E[\\bar{x}]\\) where \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}\\) E.G find the expected value of an average 2.4.5 A solution First, we can factor out the 1/n, so we have \\[\\frac{1}{n}E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}\\right]\\] then we can say that the sum is just \\(x_1+x_2+x_3+ ... + x_n\\). This would lead us to the conclusion that \\[ E[\\bar{x}] =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}E\\left[x_i\\right]\\] If we let each \\(x_i\\) be a constant then we have: \\[ E[\\bar{x}] =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i = \\bar{x}\\] This makes sense as \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the average value of x, and so the expected value of x for a very high n is the average value of x 2.5 Variance and Covariance 2.5.1 Variance The variance is the dispersion. Variance is defined as \\[\\mathrm{Var}\\left(X\\right) = E \\left[\\left(X-\\mu\\right)^2\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(x - \\mu\\right)^{2}f\\left(x\\right)dx = \\sigma^2\\] \\[\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}\\left(X\\right) }= \\sum\\left(x_i - \\bar{x}\\right)^2\\] 2.5.2 Covariance Assume we have two RVs, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = E\\left[\\left(X - \\mu_x\\right)\\left(Y - \\mu_y\\right)\\right]\\] \\[\\widehat{\\mathrm{Cov}\\left(X,Y\\right) }= \\sum\\left(x_i - \\bar{x}\\right)\\left(y_i - \\bar{y}\\right)\\] The variance is, in essence, the sum of cross products. 2.5.3 Some generalizations on covariance: If y tends to increase with x, then \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)&gt;0\\) If Y tends to decrease with X, then \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)\\) is Less than 0 If it appears as a random cloud, then \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)\\) is approximately 0 2.5.4 A challenge Let \\(X\\) be a RV. What is \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(X,X)\\)? 2.5.5 A solution \\[\\mathrm{Cov}(X,X) = E\\left[\\left(X - \\mu_x\\right)\\left(X - \\mu_X\\right)\\right]\\] We see that the arguments in the left and right parens are exactly the same. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as: \\[\\mathrm{Cov}(X,X) = E \\left[\\left(X - \\mu_x\\right)^2\\right] = \\mathrm{Var}(X) \\] 2.5.6 A note on covariance and correlation Correlation is covariance but standardized. \\[\\mathrm{Corr}(X,Y) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\mathrm{SD}(X)\\mathrm{SD}(Y)}\\] \\[ =\\frac{E[X - \\mu_x)(Y-\\mu_y)]}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}\\] \\[ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Corr}(X,Y)} = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{ns_x s_y}\\] "],

Important result: If we assume constant mean, we can use all of the data to estimate the mean Here we can see after 5 realizations that the mean is clearly not constant with time library(tswge) a1 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(3, 0), vara = 3, plot = F) b1 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(3, 0), vara = 3, plot = F) c1 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(3, 0), vara = 3, plot = F) d1 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(3, 0), vara = 3, plot = F) e1 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(3, 0), vara = 3, plot = F) Now lets look at 5 realizations which come from the same realization, which might not have a constant mean: a2 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(runif(1, 0, 2 * pi), 0), vara = 3, plot = F) b2 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(runif(1, 0, 2 * pi), 0), vara = 3, plot = F) c2 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(runif(1, 0, 2 * pi), 0), vara = 3, plot = F) d2 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(runif(1, 0, 2 * pi), 0), vara = 3, plot = F) e2 = gen.sigplusnoise.wge(100, coef = c(5, 0), freq = c(0.1, 0), psi = c(runif(1, 0, 2 * pi), 0), vara = 3, plot = F) We cannot say for sure whether the mean is constant or not in this case! 3.2 Condition Two: Constant Variance Variance does not depend on time Variance is constant and finite* That is : \\[Var[X_t] = \\sigma^2 \\neq \\infty\\] If we can make this assumption, then we can use all of the data to make the variance. This is typically the hardest one to tell, and it will take some practice to see. 3.3 Condition 3: Constant autocorrelation Correlation of \\(X_{t_1} and X_{t_2}\\) only depends on \\(t_2 - t_1\\) That is, the correlation between points depends only on how far apart they are in time, not where they are in time. To describe this mathematically: Let \\[h = t_2 - t_1\\] then \\[\\mathrm{Cor}\\left(X_t,X_{t+h}\\right) = \\rho_h\\] \\(\\rho\\) represents the population correlation coefficient. "],

Too lazy to tex up the equations. Basically, we can decompose any function into a bunch of sines and cosines. It is pretty rad.

So we are probably going to have to make some estimates. Lets first estimate autocorrelation: \\[S_x(f) = 1+2 \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\widehat{\\rho_k} \\mathrm{cos}\\left( 2 \\pi f k\\right), \\mid f \\mid = 0.5\\] Now lets deal with the infinity, which is killing us. We know that: \\[\\hat\\rho_1 = \\frac { \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^n-1 (X_t - \\bar{X})(X_{t+1} - \\bar{X}) }{\\hat\\gamma_0}\\] And (check yourself to see the math works) \\[\\hat\\rho_{n-1} = (X_1 - \\bar X)(X_n - \\bar(x)) /(n\\hat\\gamma_0)\\] We can then rewrite the sample spectral density/sample spectrum as!: \\[S_x(f) = 1+2 \\sum_{k = 1}^{n-1} \\widehat{\\rho_k} \\mathrm{cos}\\left( 2 \\pi f k\\right), \\mid f \\mid = 0.5\\] However, this estimate of autocorrelation cannot be very good, since it is estimated using one cross product/pair. Thats like estimating the mean with one value! So, lets stop this sum somewhere more reasonable. \\[\\widehat{S_x(f)} = 1+2 \\sum_{k = 1}^{M} \\widehat{\\rho_k} \\mathrm{cos}\\left( 2 \\pi f k\\right), \\mid f \\mid = 0.5\\] Where M is less than \\(n-1\\). This lets us have a bit more freedom to decide what M should be. Let us now rewrite the estimate of spectral density as: \\[\\widehat{S_x(f)} = \\lambda_0 1+2 \\sum_{k = 1}^{M} \\lambda_k\\widehat{\\rho_k} \\mathrm{cos}\\left( 2 \\pi f k\\right), \\mid f \\mid = 0.5\\] Where \\(\\mid\\lambda_k \\mid\\) decreases as k increases. With this, we have M minimizing and limiting the impact of sample autocorrelations when k gets pretty close to n, and lambda further decreases the impact of the poor sample autocorrelations at high values of k. These are called window functions. In our case, we will use what is called the Parzen window. Other windows (every statistician in the 60’s had their own window) include: the Tukey window, the Bartlett window, etc. We call this the the smooth spectral density estimator. \\(M\\) is frequently chosen to be \\(2 \\sqrt n\\) 8.3 Spectral Density in the Wild First, lets look at a simple example: x &lt;- 1:1000 y &lt;- sin(x) par(mfrow = c(2, 1)) curve(sin(x), 1, 1000) parzen.wge(y) Shockingly, we have a frequency peak at roughly \\(\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} = 0.1591549\\). If I did a better job of generating the data, it would be a super shark peak and nothing else, however I did not. Lets look at sunspot data now: par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) data(sunspot.classic) tplot(sunspot.classic) + ggthemes::theme_few() parzen.wge(sunspot.classic) It looks like we have a frequency peak at about 0.1, which makes sense because the classic sunspot psuedoperiod is about 11 years. Lets look at some aperiodic stock data now: getSymbols(&quot;GOOG&quot;, src = &quot;yahoo&quot;) plot(GOOG[, &quot;GOOG.Close&quot;]) parzen.wge(GOOG$GOOG.Close) Sadly, there appears to be no real periodicity in google’s stock price, no free money for us :(. The peak at 0 means that the data is either aperiodic or it has not been long enough to show a period. 8.4 Why do we do spectral density from -0.5 to 0.5? Time series data is taken in integers. What is the shortest distance between two integeres that we can complete a period in? It is 2. This means the highest obesrvable frequency is 0.5. Interestingly, if you look at sin(2pi.3t) and sin(2pi1.3t) at the integers, we will have exactly the same value. This means that even if the frequency is higher, we will have it be aliased to be exactly the same as the lower frequency function: x &lt;- 0:100 y1 &lt;- sin(2 * pi * 0.3 * x) y2 &lt;- sin(2 * pi * 1.3 * x) round(y2 - y1, 2) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [36] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [71] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 This is called aliasing.
